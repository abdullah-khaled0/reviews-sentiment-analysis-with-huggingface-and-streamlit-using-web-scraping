# Reviews Sentiment Analysis with HuggingFace Transformers and Streamlit using Web Scraping

## 💡 Idea
The project idea is to analyze the sentiment of customer reviews regarding a specific product, service, etc. By utilizing web scraping, you can extract customer reviews and then use HuggingFace transformers models to determine their sentiment. For instance, whether they are happy with the product/service or not, or if they have any disappointments with a particular service, etc.

## 📍 Project Data
The data used in this project is sourced from the Trustpilot website, which is dedicated to reviews about various companies.
